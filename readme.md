# Infrastrcuture as a code simplfied

This purpose of this repo is to demonstrate how to automate building infrastructure that will be used as a foundation to run the production-grade applications. Most importantly using the programing language that you know and using building your business applications, programming languages like javascript, python etc.

This is not another **Infa as a Code** demo, this demo is created using [Pulumi] (https://www.pulumi.com/docs/) which provides simplicity and natural adoption of the framework while keeping the declarative style of programming.
